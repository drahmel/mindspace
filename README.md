Mindspace is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to build a world using a standard GUI much like WordPress or Joomla.

The goals of Mindspace are as follows:

* Code is licensed with the MIT license so it can be used for almost any use: commercial or open source.
* Provide a toolkit so even beginning coders can create 3D worlds with Mindspace
* Make it easy to launch a server using Mindspace or simply use the library in your own code

Getting Started
================

Starting a Mindscape server is easy:

* Clone the source code
* Put in the code in a web-accessible directory
* Access in a browser

Notes
=====

* Examples will use the KISS-MVC framework since it has a single file implementation. This simplicity means that the code can be easily adapted to any PHP framework of choice (Zend, Code Igniter, Yii, etc.).
* File format will be JSON-based and extensible -- custom properties can be easily added



Data can be stored to a file (for simple static worlds) or Redis.
